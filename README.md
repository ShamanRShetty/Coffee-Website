# ☕ Coffee Website

Welcome to the **Coffee Website project**, a modern, stylish, and fully responsive front-end coffee shop landing page. This project was built as part of my learning journey in front-end web development by following a YouTube tutorial and manually typing out the code for deeper understanding.

Whether you're a coffee lover, student, or aspiring front-end developer, this website template is ideal for showcasing coffee menus, customer testimonials, a photo gallery, and contact details.
